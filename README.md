## Hook-Redux

Testing the implementation of React hooks and context as a way to replace redux on small and medium size projects.

Store and Reducer are combined into StorePrivder.js and Actions is in an independent file.
All inside context folder.

######Next tests:

- [ ] Separate Reducer;
- [ ] Test isolating Dispatch as it's own context to provide the option to some components only update the state but not get affected by the state update.
