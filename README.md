## Hooks-Redux

Testing the implementation of React hooks and context as a way to replace redux on small and medium size projects.

Store and Reducer are combined into StorePrivder.js and Actions is in an independent file.
All inside context folder.

##### Next tests:

- [ ] Isolate Reducer
- [ ] Test adding Dispatch to it's own context to provide the option to some components update the state but don't get affected by the state update.
